## 🛠️ **Plugins and Tools:**

1. **Telescope** 📜  
   A powerful fuzzy finder for searching files, buffers, and more within your project.  
   **Key Features:** File navigation, live grep, and quick access to recently used files.

2. **Tokyonight** 🎨  
   My preferred theme for a modern, dark, and visually pleasing coding experience.  
   **Note:** It supports true color and looks fantastic with transparency enabled.

3. **Conform.nvim** ✨  
   For effortless code formatting across multiple languages.  
   **Configuration:** Set to auto-format on save and configured with support for popular formatters.

4. **Mason.nvim** 🔧  
   An all-in-one package manager for LSP servers, linters, and formatters.  
   **LSP Support:** Integrated with `mason-lspconfig` and `nvim-lspconfig` to handle language servers seamlessly.
